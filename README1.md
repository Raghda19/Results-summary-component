### What I learned

I used bootstrap grid to divine the {div1 and div2} as columns in row. 

To adjust the width of the website to fit moblie {width=375px} and desktop {width=1440px} i used [@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }] which is mean // Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)// i tried to use [@media (max-width: 375px) { ... }] but i didn't work.


```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xl-6">col</div>
    <div class="co-xl-6">col</div> 
</div>
```
```css
@media (max-width: 575.98px) {
 ```      



### Continued development

I need to focus on those two areas:
-@media
